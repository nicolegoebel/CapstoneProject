This repo contains files all related to a project for the finalization of the Coursera Data Science specialization. The aim of the project was to formulate a text prediction algorith, such as that used on texting apps and word processors.

The milestone report discusses some of the analyses and methods used to analyze the text files that were used to train the model. It also discusses some strategies for formulating a text prediction algorithm.

The folder `Rscripts` contains the R scripts used to process txt files and train the model.

The shiny folder contains the Rscripts used to create the shinyio.app.

The presentation folder contains a short 5-slide presentation that summarizes the project.
